The Playlist Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage and manipulate playlists of songs. It allows users to load songs from a dataset, create playlists, and perform various operations such as playing the next song, skipping songs, prioritizing songs, shuffling the playlist, and adding new tracks. The system leverages abstract data types like Deque, Stack, and List to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

Key features include:
- Loading songs from a CSV dataset.
- Playing, skipping, and prioritizing songs.
- Shuffling the playlist and displaying song details.
- Stress testing to evaluate performance under heavy load.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data structures and provides a user-friendly command-line interface for managing playlists.
